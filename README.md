Tasks
Task 1: Calculate the Sum of Numbers from 1 to n
Objective: Write a program to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to n.
Steps:
Write a simple C program to compute the sum.
Compile and execute using:
GCC
RISC-V GCC with -Ofast optimization level.
RISC-V GCC with -O1 optimization level.

Task 2: Debugging in SPIKE Simulator
Objective: Compile the C program from Task 1 using the RISC-V toolchain and debug it step by step using SPIKE.
Steps:
Compile the program using:
Ofast optimization level
O1 optimization level
Run and debug in SPIKE:
Load the program in SPIKE.
Step through each instruction and observe the changes in the register values and memory.
Repeat the process for the -Ofast version and compare the results.
