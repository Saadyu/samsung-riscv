## üîß Tasks Overview

### üìù **Task 1**: Calculate the Sum of Numbers from 1 to \( n \)

#### Objective  
Write a program to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to \( n \).  

#### Steps  
1. Write a simple C program to calculate the sum.  
2. Compile and execute the program using:  
   - **GCC**  
   - **RISC-V GCC** with the `-Ofast` optimization level.  
   - **RISC-V GCC** with the `-O1` optimization level.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Task 2**: Debugging in SPIKE Simulator

#### Objective  
Compile the C program from Task 1 using the RISC-V toolchain and debug it step by step using the SPIKE simulator.

#### Steps  
1. **Compile the Program**:  
   - Use the RISC-V GCC compiler with the following optimization levels:  
     - `-Ofast`  
     - `-O1`  

2. **Run and Debug in SPIKE**:  
   - Load the program into SPIKE.  
   - Use SPIKE's interactive debugging mode to:  
     - Step through each instruction.  
     - Observe changes in **register values** and **memory contents**.  
   - Repeat the debugging process for the `-Ofast` version and compare results with the `-O1` version.
